### Building instructions

![Render Vacuum Former](assets/render-vacuum-former.png)

You can build the Vacuum Former from the following [Fusion 360 Model](http://a360.co/2iWRcxN)

In the folder you can find a Parametric design that can be customized to make an arbitrary size. The wider the bed, the more powerful the vacuum should be.

For Laser Cutting you can export the shapes for all bodies and create a layout on a piece of wood or acrylic.

3D Print the hose connector adapting it to the size of your vacuum cleaner.

### Operating instructions

- Place a small object on the bed. Make sure it doesn't melt when heated for short periods of time to more than 100c

- Place a sheet of PETG between the frame, cut it at size in a way that doesn't cover the screw holes

- Position the frame using the reference screws as shown in the figure at the top of the page

- Heat up the PETG sheet using an heat-gun for PCBs. Wait till the PETG sheet bends significantly. 

- Move the frame towards the bed and quickly turn on the vacuum cleaner, keep heating the sheet when it doesn't completely stick to the bed.
